# Weekly Journal

## Week 1

### Day 1, 2023-09-25
First day did not start until 14:00 in the afternoon so we just had time for a simple onboarding, we were shown were we would sit during our internship.

We had time to start our sprintplanning for our project and called it a day at around 18:30

### Day 2, 2023-09-26
Spent a good chunk of the day getting the anodet repo to work.  
Once that was done I tested the PaDiM model in the repo.  
Here is an example of how I noted down how the model behaved.
```
resnet18
- Image scores: tensor([26.2478, 21.5471, 23.0032, 10.2540,  9.6295])
  Image classifications: tensor([0., 0., 0., 1., 1.])  

wide_resnet50
- Image scores: tensor([32.4158, 28.3042, 28.7167, 12.9971, 17.5561])
  Image classifications: tensor([0., 0., 0., 1., 0.])  

- Bottle:
  Image scores: tensor([26.2478, 21.5471, 23.0032, 10.2540,  9.6295])  
  Image classifications: tensor([0., 0., 0., 1., 1.])  

- Capsule:
  Image scores: tensor([35.6994, 17.5745, 23.3754, 10.9613,  6.1606])  
  Image classifications: tensor([0., 0., 0., 1., 1.])
  ```


I also fixed some old dependencies.  
I started researching a tool to create a UML for the project. 

### Day 3, 2023-09-27
I used PlantUML to create a UML which uses a proprietary "programming language" to create UML's through text. I had to install Graphviz and Java to make it work.  
  
Read through the PaDiM research paper to get a better understanding how padim actually works and took extensive notes to better remember. 

#### For example:
##### Model Training for PaDiM: 

MVTec AD class with 10,000 images using the following data augmentation operations: random rotation ($-2^\circ$, $+2^\circ$) degrees, resize to 292x292, random crop to 282x282, and finally center crop to 256x256. The training is performed during 100 epochs with the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of $10^{-4}$.

Got several cameras to work on my computer simultaneously through Williams camera script.

### Day 4, 2023-09-28
First day of problem solving. We had issues with William who uses macOS and myself using Windows.  
The camera script was extremely slow on windows and could only display a max of 2 cameras.  
  
  I started with trouble shooting and created a new script that opened every camera one at a time to check that Python could find all of them, which it could. 

  Finally found a fix later in the day:
  ```py
          cap = (
            cv2.VideoCapture(idx, cv2.CAP_DSHOW)
            if os_name == "Windows"
            else cv2.VideoCapture(idx)
        )
  ```
  cv2.CAP_DSHOW allows opencv2 to get backend access to the Windows operating system, increasing the speed.

### Day 5, 2023-09-28
Finally a day full of coding!
I wrote two scripts, one for creating a folder structure to house our images. It uses args for the anomalies to make it more flexible which I was very happy with.
#### create_warehouse_directory.py:
```py
def build(self, object_name: str = "object", anomalies: List[str] = []):

if __name__ == "__main__":
    builder = WarehouseBuilder()
    builder.build()

```
#### ‚Üë - code snippet

The other script was to actually take the images and store them in the folders so that we can use the images to train and test our model.
#### camera.py
```py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    warehouse = WarehouseBuilder()
    warehouse.build("object_name", ["anomaly1", "anomaly2"])
    camera_manager = CameraManager(warehouse)
    camera_manager.run()
```

## Conclusion
Week 1 has been a rollercoaster of onboarding, coding, and problem-solving. From setting up our workstations to diving deep into PaDiM and UMLs, every day was a learning curve. I tackled issues head-on, like the camera script's OS compatibility, and even got multiple cameras to work simultaneously. I also managed to write scripts that not only build a data warehouse but also populate it with images for our model training. Looking forward to more coding and fewer issues in the coming weeks.

## Week 2

### Day 6, 2023-10-02
#### Summary
- Developed **camera_identifier.py** and integrated it with camera.py

- Explored multi-threading for camera.py but opted for optimization
- Investigated USB information for all cameras


#### Details

    I considered using multi-threading to speed up camera.py. However, after some research, I realized that multi-threading was not the best fit for this project. Instead, I found that the code was inefficient because it was opening and checking every camera before each capture.

    I also spent time researching how to identify the specific USB device number for each camera, aiming for more precise control over the hardware. 

### Day 7, 2023-10-03
#### Summary
- Upgraded the the flexibility of camera.py to allow for capturing test or training images, or both
- Cleaned up the code in main and utils/camera_identifier
- Achieved a capture speed of 250 images in less than 8 seconds with camera.py

#### Details
    I managed to make camera.py faster by addressing the inefficiency issue identified on Day 6. The code is now optimized to avoid unnecessary camera checks, resulting in a significant speed boost. **‚Üí ‚Üí ‚Üí**


### Day 8, 2023-10-04
#### Summary

- Created a CameraIdentifier class
- Restructured utils and added an exposure test
- Fixed a bug that caused camera.py to break
- Assisted in an extra lesson for the AI23 class at school

#### Details

    The CameraIdentifier class allows us to determine the order of each camera and save this information to camera_config.json. This enables the program to use the cameras in the user-defined order, providing more control over the capture process.

    I restructured the utils directory to make the code more modular and easier to maintain. This also paved the way for adding new features like the exposure test.

    Lastly, I joined Andreas in assisting the AI23 class with their Python lessons. This was not only helpful for the class but also an excellent opportunity for my own personal growth.

### Day 9, 2023-10-05
#### Summary
- Added 'CameraConfigurator' Class to change White Balance (WB) and Color Temperature  

- Began restructuring the MCCP repository to comply with PyPI standards

- Moved CameraIdentifier and Configurator classes to the utils directory
 
- Fixed a bug related to saving to the same configuration file

#### Details
    Continuing from Day 8 I added a new class called CameraConfigurator. This class is designed to handle White Balance and Color Temperature settings, offering more control over the camera's output.  
    I started aligning the MCCP repo with PyPI standards for easier installation and use. Moved the new CameraIdentifier and Configurator classes to utils.py to simplify our codebase.  
    Also fixed a bug that prevented saving to the same JSON config file, allowing for easier updates.


### Day 10, 2023-10-06
#### Summary

- :boot: **Bug Squashing day!**
- :bug: Fixed four bugs
#### Details

Initially, when an image was captured, it would "lag" behind, displaying the previous image. This issue was resolved by implementing a frame buffer. The first few frames are now discarded before saving an image, ensuring that an outdated picture is not saved.

Here are the bug descriptions:

    BUG üêõ: In CameraManager, observed after adding a pause between pictures
    BUG üêõ: The first image taken contained exposure data from the previous camera_config
    BUG üêõ: CameraConfigurator always runs, even when Camera Exposure and Color Temperature already exist in camera_config.json
    BUG üêõ: clean_file_names creates two subdirectories if there is a space in the anomaly name‚Äîone with a space and one with an underscore. It should only create one.


### Conclusion: 
The second week was focused on refining and expanding the MCCP project. I tackled performance issues in camera.py, introduced new classes for better camera control, and started the process of making the repository PyPI-compliant.  

Alongside these technical improvements, I also took the opportunity to assist in an AI class, which was a rewarding experience.
